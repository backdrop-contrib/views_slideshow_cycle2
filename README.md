Views Slideshow: Cycle2
=======================

'Views Slideshow: Cycle2' is an integration of the
[Cycle2 jQuery plugin](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/) with the
[Views Slideshow](https://backdropcms.org/project/views_slideshow) module.

Some of the benefits of using Cycle2 over the original Cycle plugin (which comes
bundled with Views Slideshow) are the inclusion of responsive design and, with
an optional plugin, swipe events on capable devices.

This module depends on:

- [Views Slideshow](https://backdropcms.org/project/views_slideshow)
- [Libraries](https://backdropcms.org/project/libraries)

It's based on the
[Drupal sandbox module](https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/BenYoung/1832338) of the
same name.

Installation
------------

- Install this module, and its dependencies, using the official Backdrop CMS
  instructions at https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

  [plugins](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/download/) into the same folder
